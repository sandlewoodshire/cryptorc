Feel free to use this code in your own project.
     If you use this in a project send me a note and let me know it was useful.
     If you build off this code and decide to share your work, I would appreciate some credit in the comments.

This code would not be possible if it wasn't for:
     Adafruit's CharLCD Library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_CharLCD
     Chris Hager's RPIO (v2 beta) Library https://github.com/metachris/RPIO
  
Hopefully you picked on on the fact you need to download and install these libraries for this to work.
